My research and teaching focus on software quality assurance. My research has a particular emphasis on “black-box” components - software units that lack documentation and cannot be scrutinised internally. I specialise in applying Machine Learning and other data analysis algorithms to the specific activities of testing, reverse-engineering, and safety-case assessment.

I studied my Ph.D. (2002-2005) at the [University of Strathclyde](https://www.strath.ac.uk/science/computerinformationsciences/){:target="\_blank"} on the use of static analysis to support software inspections, under the supervision of [Marc Roper](https://www.strath.ac.uk/staff/ropermarcdr/){:target="\_blank"} and [Murray Wood](https://personal.cis.strath.ac.uk/murray.wood/){:target="\_blank"}. I subsequently spent five years (2005-2010) as a postdoc at the [University of Sheffield](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/indexdcs){:target="\_blank"}, working variously with [Kirill Bogdanov](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/kbogdanov){:target="\_blank"}, [John Derrick](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/jderrick){:target="\_blank"}, and [Phil McMinn](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/dcs/people/academic/pmcminn){:target="\_blank"}. This was followed by 8 years as a Lecturer then Senior Lecturer / Associate Professor at the [Department of Informatics](https://www2.le.ac.uk/departments/informatics){:target="\_blank"} at the University of Leicester. I took up my current position at the University of Sheffield in 2018.
