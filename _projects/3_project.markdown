There are often situations in which it is necessary to arrive at some decision or assessment, even though the underlying evidence is uncertain or partial. This project has developed structured reasoning techniques that can accommodate this sort of information.

Much of this work has focussed on the application of software assessments. Software quality and safety tends to be assessed via hierarchical models (software quality models or safety argument structures). We have shown how probabilistic techniques (based upon a Dempster-Shaefer belief models) can be used to make these assessments more transparent, and can enable the assessor to explicitly factor in their doubt or ignorance about different aspects of the decision process.

The research has not, however, been restricted to software systems. We have also worked on collaborative projects with [AWE](http://www.awe.co.uk/){:target="\_blank"}, [DSTL](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory){:target="\_blank"}, [Fraser-Nash Consulting](https://www.fnc.co.uk/){:target="\_blank"} and [Qinetiq](https://www.qinetiq.com/){:target="\_blank"} to develop more reliable information in sensing environments and with respect to autonomous vehicle communications (e.g. to accommodate sensor failures or data blackouts).
