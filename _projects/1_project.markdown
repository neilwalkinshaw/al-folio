I have recently developed an interest in causality, in statistical approaches that can be used to establish evidence of it, and in its relation to software engineering. 

There are lots of interesting approaches from Casual Inference that could, in the context of Software Testing, lead to new and powerful ways to reason about software behaviour, and in particular the relationship between particular inputs and buggy behaviour.

This work is being carried out on the EPSRC-funded CITCOM project, with my colleagues Rob Hierons, Michael Foster and Andy Clark, along with Nick Latimer in ScHARR and David Wagg in Mechanical Engineering. The project also features (or will feature!) collaborations with several industrial partners (STFC and DSTL), as well as international academic partners (Robert Feldt at Chalmers and Andy Podgurski at Case Western Reserve).
